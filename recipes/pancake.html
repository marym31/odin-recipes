    <h1> PANCAKE </h1>

    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> This was the DIY pancake syrup I grew up with. 
        It tastes fabulous without all the extra work 
        of getting real tapped maple syrup. It's also 
        a cheaper way to have syrup, as these are things
         I always have in my cupboard.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li> ½ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li> 1 cup water</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon maple flavored extract </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> In a saucepan, combine white sugar, brown sugar, and water. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li> Stir in maple extract and vanilla, and remove form the heat. Let cool.</li>
        <li> Serve at room temperature. Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator. (It may crystallize a little if the container is not completely airtight.)</li>
    </ol>
